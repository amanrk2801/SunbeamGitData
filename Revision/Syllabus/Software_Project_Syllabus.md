# Software Project
## PG-DAC February 2025

**Duration:** 90 hours

**Objective:** In addition to the specific subject knowledge, the Software Project module attempts to put into practice a number of things that the students have learned during the PG-DAC course, such as:
- Ability to work in a team
- Software development methodology and principles
- Good programming practices
- Technical reporting and presentation.

**Prerequisites:** Completion of the basic modules on Programming, Data Structures, and Database to start Phase I of the Project.

**Evaluation:** Grading based on the combined marks obtained in the evaluations of all the 3 phases.  
**Weightage:** 
- Phase I – 10%
- Phase II – 10%
- Phase III – 80% (Mid Evaluation 20% + Final Evaluation 60%)

## Final Project Schedule

Students, in teams, will be required to identify project topics in consultation with faculty members within the first three months of the course.

The Project module is divided in three phases:

### Phase I – SRS Phase

**Tasks:** Requirements gathering, feasibility study and project thinking.

**Deliverable:** Software Requirement Specification (SRS).

**Schedule:** Initiated after the delivery of the basic modules. This phase will be executed along with the Software Engineering part of the Software Development Methodologies module to enable better absorption of the concepts.

### Phase II – Design Phase

**Tasks:** Software design and project plan.

**Deliverable:** Students will present the design and plan on the schema of the project.

**Schedule:** This phase will be executed during the final part of the Software Development Methodologies module.

### Phase III – Development Phase

**Tasks:** Coding and testing of the software system/application.

**Deliverables:** Project report, functional software system/application.

**Schedule:** This final phase will be executed during the last 15 days of the course. A mid evaluation at the middle of the project development, and a final evaluation at the end of the project will be done.
